Create Key

ls -al ~/.ssh  -  shows what keys you do have
ssh-keygen -C "username@domain"

chmod 700
	600

pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard

# start the ssh-agent in the background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
# Agent pid 59566
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

$ ssh -l tommy
will log you in as tommy.

You can also make this persistent per-host by having a record like this in
 ~/.ssh/config:

Host creative_pc
User tommy
HostName creative_pc.net #or ip address

$ ssh creative_pc # this is the string from Host setting
